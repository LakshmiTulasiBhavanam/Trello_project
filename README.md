# Trello_project
1.	Create an account on Trello.com. Also create a workspace and board if not exists in which you want to add the new card.
2.	API Key: We need an API key for accessing the Trello account. A distinct API key can now be assigned to each Power-Up and maintained by any collaborator. For each Power-Up, the "API key" provides easy access to viewing and managing any developer API keys, authorized origins, and secrets.
First, we need to create power-up. You can use the existing power-up if created one previously. In power-up admin portal, you can manage and access the power-up existing in your Tello account. Here, you can get the API key related to your power-up.
3.	Token: In the power-up admin portal, you can find the link to generate the token. We also need the token for our application.
4.	Board Id: You would need the board id for which you want to add the card. To get the board Id, add .json to the link of the board and you will find the board id.
5.	Add API key, token, and board Id to the program and test it.


Next Development Steps:
The below are the additional upgrade points for the API we created.
1.	Create a full application with front end and backend to visualize the results.
2.	Adding more functionality like moving tasks from To Do, Doing and Done status.
3.	Adding the functionality for creating the board and lists in Trello.
